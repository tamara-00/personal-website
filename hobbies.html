        <h1>Reading</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Books are my gateway to endless adventures, knowledge, and new perspectives. I love diving into different
            genres, from gripping thrillers and timeless classics to insightful non-fiction. Each book is an
            opportunity to escape reality, explore new worlds, and meet fascinating characters. Reading not
            only enriches my mind but also fuels my imagination and creativity, making it an indispensable
            part of my life.

        <h1>Hiking</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Hiking is my way of connecting with nature and finding tranquility in the great outdoors. There's
            something incredibly rejuvenating about walking through scenic trails, breathing in fresh air, and
            marveling at breathtaking landscapes. Whether it's a challenging uphill trek or a leisurely forest
            walk, hiking offers a perfect balance of physical activity and mental relaxation. It's a reminder of
            the beauty that exists beyond our everyday surroundings and a source of inspiration and peace.
        </p>

    <h1>Tennis</h1>
        <br>
    <p>Tennis has always been more than just a sport for me—it's a passion that keeps me active and engaged.
        Whether I'm on the court practicing my serve or playing a match with friends, the game brings a
        unique blend of physical exertion and strategic thinking. The sound of a perfect hit, the rush
        of chasing down a shot, and the satisfaction of a well-placed winner are unmatched experiences that
        keep me coming back for more.

    <p class="last-sentence">Engaging in these hobbies — tennis, reading, and hiking — brings a well-rounded balance to my life,
        keeping me healthy, curious, and grounded.
